# Sp19-FinalProj

## Final Project (25 %) – You get to choose what you want to do
* Extend one of Gibson’s prototypes with a complete UI, a start screen, end screen, help screen and a method for restarting the game. You also need to add several features such as those described at the end of the chapter. You must provide a list of which features you are adding to me prior to implementation. 
* Implement Dungeon Delver (Gibson – Chapter 35) 
* Implement Gibson’s Bartok  AND WordGame
* Implement an exterior level design that fits a narrative. Provide a write-up of the purpose of the scene, a top down map (photoshop/illustrator) with major areas/buildings defined. The area and any buildings must make sense together. There should be a prototype of gameplay within the 3D space utilizing the 3D walker prefab. 
* Download the Unity asset, ProBuilder and greybox an interior level design. It should have intermediate objectives and should flow logically.
* Propose a topic. Is there a game idea you would like to prototype? Tell me what you are planning and I will try to keep you from biting off more than you can chew
